Actionable Insights & Visuals - This is the most important deliverable. We want to see if you have the product sense to surface insights beyond surface level that social media managers would find useful. Quality > Quantity.

Well-Organized Codebase - Clear folder structure, README, meaningful commit history, no superfluous files

Robust Data Pipeline - Modular functions or classes for each stage, graceful error handling
Thoughtful Extension Plan - A good senior engineer makes their own scope. How would you expand the scope of this project if you had a month?
